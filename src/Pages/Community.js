            <p>While Halloween has come and gone, the costumes are still out—and they’re detailed, intricate and bespoke pieces of work.

Young pop culture fans packed the rafters of Labim Mall for the first day of Comcoscon’s seventh convention, to revel in anime and manga, gaming and pop culture. Fans of all ages attended, with some dressing in full cosplay livery.

Comic Cos Con is a comic and cosplay convention that celebrates and showcases its own community, organised by Otaku Next, a group that celebrates Japanese pop culture. The burgeoning group holds several events over the course of Comcoscon, all surrounding manga, anime, cosplay, gaming and pop culture.
