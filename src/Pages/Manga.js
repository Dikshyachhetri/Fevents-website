            <p>To put it briefly, manga is the Japanese word for comics published in Japan. The word itself is comprised of two characters: man 漫 meaning “whimsical” and ga 画 meaning “pictures.”

Manga can be for entertainment or education, although in the United States manga for entertainment is what is mostly translated and published. Manga is for people of all ages and it is not seen as something just for children as compared to how sometimes American comics are viewed. 

In Japan, manga is published in manga magazines such as Shōnen Jump or Shōjo Beat, multiple chapters at time, then republished into tankōbon volumes. These tankōbon volumes are what you would see in your local library or book store in the United States. Manga is printed in black and white usually because of the expense, but sometimes there are special editions that include full color chapters. </p>
