            <p>The growth of anime in North America is unquestionable, even if it is a little difficult to quantify. We know that Crunchyroll has over 2 million paid subscribers, which is twice what they had 18 months earlier, and we know they are up to 40 million registered users. We don’t know how Funimation or Netflix or Amazon are doing with anime, nor are we ever likely to. So how can we measure it? There are a lot of ideas floating around out there (including starting a Nielsen-style service for anime!), but who knows if/when that will come to pass. In the meantime, we have events.

This is the second in a series of articles leading up to Project Anime, the anime business conference preceding Anime Expo. Taking place July 2-3 in Los Angeles, Project Anime will bring together business leaders to talk about the growth of anime and of anime events, which, as you’re about to learn, have increased a lot over the past few decades.

Anime conventions got their start in the 1980s and were similar to comic-cons; they were groups of fans coming together to talk about the stuff they loved. Being an anime fan back then was not a simple thing as it required trading fansubs on VHS tapes. In fact, it was only by going to these conventions that fans could see some anime at all. Viewing rooms were an essential part of the experience, offering a small number of shows on a small screen with dozens of people crowded around it. An entire convention would attract hundreds of people, the big ones would go over a thousand.</p>
