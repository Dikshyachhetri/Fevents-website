            <h3>The Cosplay Competition</h3>
                <ol>
The Cosplay Competition is meant for anyone who has sewn/constructed/assembled/welded/cast or summoned a cosplay, and would like to present it on stage. Any person who has made their cosplay, without professional assistance, is allowed to sign up. Those who signed up for the contest are judged on the day of the convention. The Cosplay competition has three categories – Singles, Veteran singles and Groups.

<h3> Skit Contest</h3>
                <ol>
A skit is an acting piece, dance or performance which is presented by cosplayers on stage. A skit can be anything – from a satirical sketch to a dance piece fitting for the character. Those who signed up for the skit contest are judged on the day of the convention, during the cosplay event.
